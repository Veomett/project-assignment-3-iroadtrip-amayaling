Road Trip

This assignment calculates the shortest path from country 1 to country 2. It takes into consideration countries that border each other, and countries that do not border each other but still have a path to each other. 

Ah this was crazy and just.. crazy. Dijkstras is so embedded in my brain its crazy. It is not the proper implementation but it works semi well enough, and I had to submit it so here it is. I had to consult the Internet, mainly geeks for geeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-in-java-using-priorityqueue/) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/), and th Java documentation page. 

I put nearly everything into a hash map because it was easier to access data that way, as well as returning an array list to print out the path. 

I tried hard on this one but I know that the way I read the files is the cause for my biggest problems. At least its done!
